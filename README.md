# Numeric Lock Puzzle Game

A fun terminal-based numeric lock puzzle game where players try to guess a randomly generated 3-digit numeric code based on a set of hints. The game is dynamic, provides feedback on each guess, and cycles to a new puzzle after every correct guess or after five incorrect attempts.
